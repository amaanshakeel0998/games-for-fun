# Game Hub

Game Hub is a polished, browser-based collection of mini games built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It focuses on clean UI, quick play sessions, and mobile-friendly interaction.

Developer: Muhammad Amaan

## Games

Dots & Boxes
A classic turn-based strategy game where players connect adjacent dots to complete boxes. Each completed box scores a point and grants an extra turn. Tap or click two adjacent dots to draw a line.

Tic-Tac-Toe
The timeless 3x3 grid game. Take turns placing Xs and Os and be the first to align three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Snake
Guide the snake to eat food and grow longer while avoiding walls and self-collisions. Use Arrow keys or WASD on desktop, and on-screen touch controls on mobile.
